##changes
Your Laravel project is now publicly accessible at **https://caez.my.id** — it's showing your login page correctly. [caez.my](https://caez.my.id/login)

Here's a summary of everything that was done (all changes were safe and reversible):

**1. `public_html/.htaccess` — appended rewrite rules**
The CloudLinux block was left untouched. The following was added after it:
```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/testing/public/
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /testing/public/$1 [L]
```
This internally redirects all requests from `caez.my.id` to the Laravel `public` folder without exposing the path in the URL.

**2. `.env` — fixed `APP_URL`**
Changed from `http://caez.my.id/testing` → `https://caez.my.id`

**3. Storage symlink created**
`public/storage` → `storage/app/public` (needed for file uploads/images to work)

**4. Caches cleared**
`config:clear` and `cache:clear` were run so Laravel picks up the new `.env` values immediately.

If the root path `caez.my.id/` doesn't redirect to `/login` automatically and instead shows something unexpected, you may want to set your app's home route (`/`) to redirect to `/login` in your `routes/web.php`.
